# CS225-Notes
Symbols and Formulas for CS 225. This is a LaTeX version of the original course notes sheet "Notes_symbols_formulas.pdf". You can find the current PDF document (as well as the .tex document)
in the symbols_formulas folder, or [here](symbols_formulas/symbols_formulas.pdf). 

There have been 3 main versions so far:
- The original version, which was as close to an exact copy of the "Notes_symbols_formulas.pdf" as I could make.
- A version updated by a CS 225 ULA, which includes the negation law(s) (I believe this was the only change). 
- The current version, which has the following changes:
  - Improved spacing for logical statements involving `~`. 
  - The negation law is included with LaTeX code.
  - The summation section now includes all formulas from the "summation_formula_updated.pdf" document from Canvas. 

Please let me know if you find any typos in this document, or if you have suggestions for improvement!
